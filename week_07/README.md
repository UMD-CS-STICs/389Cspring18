# Politics and Regulation

This week we covered Politics and Regulations as they pertain to cryptocurrency. The slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16gHz9isZfI4FmLrra3N1zimerZbyF--4siL8xqvKT2s/edit?usp=sharing), as well as in this directory, as per usual.

We forgot to bring the quizzes to class today, so we have provided the quiz and its answers [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItI9hC3fNSTlUdJC_zXA_rqLx8GX2ZSsYaA-p2xbRes/edit?usp=sharing).

**The midterm is one week from today.** You should be studying the slides and quizzes in order to prepare, as well as asking any clarifying questions on the Piazza page. The midterm will consist of T/F, multiple choice, and short answer. You will not be required to write code. You will also not be required to understand the math behind cryptography algorithms, but you should understand the difference between them (i.e., the difference between, say, SHA-256 and ECDSA and which is used for what).
