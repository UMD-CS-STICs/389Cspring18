# Altcoins and Proof-of-Stake

Today we started our deep dive into Ethereum. The slides from today can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c2bWVBB3oVmO-aryJcn9XuBcnGPD2QpmJ12uZGUbCwE/edit?usp=sharing), as well as in this repo.
  
Project 3 has been uploaded in this directory. It is due on Friday, April 20th, at 11:59:59 PM, with a deadline of Monday, April 23rd at 11:59:59 PM for 15% penalty, as per syllabus. The purpose of the project is to get your feet wet with Ethereum's smart contracts by creating your own! As with the last project, we highly recommend starting this project early. Solidity is an entirely new language and learning to work in a smart contract environment is not trivial, so you want to give yourself time to work through it!
  
As mentioned in class, we are giving you the option to create your own original smart contract instead of the pool system we've outlined. If you want to do this, you MUST get permission from Neil and I first. In order to get permission, you must email us first with an overview of your contract and how it satisfies the constraints we've outlined for original contracts. We encourage you all to use this option! We want to see what kinds of interesting contracts you can come up with :)

As always, we have office hours on Tuesdays at 2 PM in Startup Shell if anyone needs help, and we can also schedule time outside of office hours to meet if necessary.
