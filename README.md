Your final course grade will be determined according to the following percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 20% | Quizzes | We will regularly have quizzes in class based on readings from the previous week or in-class slides/lecture. |
| 30% | Codelabs | Codelabs will be centered around specific aspects of cryptocurrency technology that you will implement. |
| 20% | Midterm | The midterm will be in exam format on topics discussed during the first half of the semester. Questions will be mostly high-level and conceptual, rather than low-level. |
| 30% | Final | The final will also be in exam format and will cover topics discussed during the second half of the semester. It will not be cumulative. Like the midterm, it will also be high-level and conceptual. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within one week of when it is returned. No requests

## Codelabs
The codelabs are meant to get you familiar with the low-level implementation of the technology that goes into cryptocurrency. Codelabs will focus on simplified implementations of core concepts, such as the blockchain, wallets and transactions, and contracts. Although most of the Bitcoin core is written in C++, the codelabs will mostly be implemented in Java or Python for simplicity.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We will interact with students outside of class in primarily two ways: in-person during office hours and piazza. Email should
only be used for emergencies and not class related questions (e.g., homework).
