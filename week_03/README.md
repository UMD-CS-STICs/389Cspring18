# Mining and Proof-of-Work

This week we went over mining and proof-of-work. As you all continue to work on the project, hopefully you've been able to see how the topics we're covering play into the projectâ€” essentially you all performed the task of mining a block for the blockchain! The slides from this week are in this folder as well as [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u6KHZHOyc5modrR3uUILo5gViwMf_KOgqtXBhvONoAc/edit?usp=sharing), and remember the project is due by Friday, February 16th at 11:59:59PM. The late deadline is Monday, February 19th at 11:59:59PM for 15% penalty, as outlined on the course webpage.
