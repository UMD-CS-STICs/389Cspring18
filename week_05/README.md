# Anonymity

Today we talked a lot about anonymity on Bitcoin's network. The slides from today can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ejrlPIcP5jzarLaDYaPLB6ib57VZzo_P5cnYCBLSK7c/edit?usp=sharing), as well as in this folder.

Project 2 has been uploaded here. It is due on Friday, March 9th, at 11:59:59 PM, with a deadline of Monday, March 12th at 11:59:59 PM for 15% penalty, as per syllabus. The purpose of the project is to act as a node on Bitcoin's network, whose job is to receive and verify transactions. **We highly recommend starting this project early.** Dealing with inputs and outputs can get a bit confusing, so you want to give yourself time to work through it! As always, we have office hours on Tuesdays at 2 PM in Startup Shell if anyone needs help, and we can also schedule time outside of office hours to meet if necessary.
