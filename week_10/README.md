# Week 10 Summary

This past week we took a look at Ethereum as a platform, and named some ways Ethereum can be used to create decentralized applications, otherwise known as dApps. You can find the slides from this week [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ud1Z-T6404f7eBCZe_ZYyoKWJIFpTlWFD2FtbdNOGzM/edit?usp=sharing), as well as in this repo.
  
The final exam is this coming Friday. Everyone needs to be in attendance. We are also working on grading project 3 and will try to have those back as soon as possible. In order to study, review the slides we went over in class. The final will not be cumulative â€” only the topics since the midterm will show up.
